
welcome back aliens my name is 720 and let's continue with the series on Python in this video we will try to focus on files but why do we need files in the first place think about this let's say if you are working with a code and of course when you write a code you will use certain variables and in those variables you will be storing some data now most of the data which we use in variables are temporary data right if you want to count a variable if you want to store some data like temporary data you will store that in a variable but what if you want to save a data in a persistent way no I mean simply for a longer period now of course the moment you close the application you will lose all the data what I want is even if I close the application I want my data to be stored somewhere and that's where you need to find a permanent storage one of the way you can do that is by using a relational database example you can use MySQL you can use Oracle but then it also provides you a table structure right and those are complex stuff what if you want to store something for a longer period but then in a simple format and the best way to go for is text so let's imagine if we have a text file here which is my data and inside this my data I have some data you can see it's my name there there is code channel name and it's a programming channel and all those stuffs right so we have this data random data and I want to use this data in a code so how do I open this file in our code I know it seems difficult by the moment you say hey how can you open external file in our code back of your mind you might be thinking oh it will be very complex but don't worry as we mentioned before python is the easiest language and to do all this stuff we already have some inbuilt functions so let's do that so one of the function or method you can use here is known as open so you simply say open you have to pass two basic parameters here the first one is the file name itself and the file name here is my data okay so you have to make sure the file name do we have the extension for this I don't think so so have to mention the file name and you need to also mention the mode now it is mode here see when I work with a file of course there are different power you can use files one of these will be used file is to rate the file one reason to open a file is to write something in it or maybe to overwrite something in it so there are different purpose right to open a file in the same way here when you open a file you have to show your purpose do you want to read a file do you want to write a file now you want to thinking why does it even matter if I open a file I want to do whatever I want see the thing is when you work on a complex system you might be working with multiple threads you want to give certain permissions and to read a file we may achieve multi-threading but to write a file you have to make sure we are using only one thread or something like that again that's a complex stuff but time being imagine whenever you open a file it's very important for a system to know what your intentions are now how do you mention your intention it's very simple you just need to use odd here the moment you say our it means you are opening this file for greeting okay so we have done with the opening your file but then if you want to handle that file you will save that file somewhere so you will say F is equal to open so you can imagine this F is a file now it's not actually it's a simply object or Die reference but you can imagine okay so time when you can say this is a file now with this file you can do certain operations example I want to print file let's see what happens when you print F as it is so I'm printing F here let's see what what it says let's run this demo and you can see F is of type text I of the wrapper with name ma Gator with a mole are so it is giving you all different features so it is giving you everything except one thing which is the data of course how do you fetch data it's very simple actually so this open in fact when you talk about files it provides you certain methods to use what are the methods which we can use here is reading so we can use read to fetch the data let's see what happens now I'm using read and let's run this code oh we got everything so it's so simple to print a data from a file in Python now what if you don't want to print the entire file you want to print only one line the first line do we have an option so the moment you say control space you can see so it has certain names we have read we have read line and then we have read lines okay so let's use read line here now when they said read line and let's see what happens read line okay just next to mine so you can see when you say read it will print everything when you said we'd line and that's one this code you can see it only prints the first line oh okay so that means when you use red line it will print on the first line what if I want to print the second line so it's very simple just copy this code so every time you said read it has a inbuilt pointer inside it so when you say read line the pointer will move to the second line now and then when you say to read right now it will fetch the second line it will the pointer will move to the third line let's verify so let's run this code you can see we are getting my name is know already and second line is the disco on YouTube now you are you thinking why we got this space here it's because print itself will give you a new line and in this data as well you have new line right so after every line you have a new line plus print will also give you a new line we don't want a new line after print so we'll say and so let's put a symbol by mentioning hash let's say when you search it means we have done with the line 1 and line 2 okay so you can see this is what it does it says hash okay so we should be doing that before as well by its time let's move that so yes so the idea is when you say when he does put and it will by default just newline so now we know how to work with red line and read can we mention the line number okay that's a question let's see if I mentioned line number four and if I don't use second one let's see what happens we accept it oh it is only printing for characters okay so when you say four it will print only four characters that's great so you can use this function and is how it works but how do we write data so we know how to read now I want to know how to write the data so in order to write the data first of all let me remove that C we cannot use our to write something we have to use W to write some things what I do is let me use another file here we'll say f1 and let me open that file and you have to mention the file name here as well so I will say the file name here is ABC and we have to mention the right commands the moment you say w it means you are trying to write something in a file but hold on if you see on the left hand side we don't have any file as ABC now what will happen so now it is smart here so when you say open a file with a write more it will first check do we have a file there so we don't have a file right so it will create a file for you let me show you so if I run this code you can see we are getting a new file which is ABC and if I open this file yes it's a text format you can see we don't have any data of course we don't have a data there right so let's ring something and the way you can print data is by saying f1 dot and you can use a write command so you can say it right and here you can write something I will say something ok let's see what happens now so let's run this code and you can see we are not printing anything in the console that's why we're not getting any stuff here let's go back to ABC and you can see a DC we got something so you can write multiple data here you can also write something let's say f1 dot and you will say people let's run this code and you can see in ABC we to get something and people of course you can give a space in between while writing this code ok so this makes sense right ok so what if if I say f1 dot right so I know that in my file we already have something and people I want to say something people laptop so in my file I want to also add a laptop how do I do that so here you will simply say laptop right that's what we are expecting here but the twist is if I have this code look at the output look at the file can you see that we lost all the previous data right so we lost something we lost people we only have laptop now it's because when you say W it simply means write define what if we don't want to write a file you want to append something if I said let's say here if I say mobile I want to obtain the moment after laptop in that case you will open a file with a so a means a painter so W is right artists raid a is a painter and now let's run this code and if I go back to ABC you can see we have laptop and mobile so remember this thing we have our we have W and we have a ok now what I wanna do is we have two files right we have ABC and we have my data what our do is I want to copy everything from my data I want to save that in ABC that's a difficult step right so first read all the data from my data and then write everything in ABC two steps first of all let's understand how do you fetch everything from my data we have seen one way right we can use red line but then how many times you will say we'd line how do we know when your file will get over that will be impossible to track so the best way is you can actually use Ford lobe and you say for data in F right so what it will do is it will run a loop and on a file F of course it will run a loop and will try to fetch everything one by one so if you can see if I print if I print data one by one and look at the output it will print everything we have extra line then right so but timed ignore that it the important thing is it is fetching everything one by one so if you have to use the same quads say when you write in ABC as well so of course you will use a for loop here you will say for the data in F and then every time you run this loop you have to say F 1 dot right and you will write a data which is data right so now it will in ABC you will have all that about from my data let's run this code go back to ABC and can you see that we got all this data here awesome right so this is how you can work with files so we can use read we can use right we can use append now just to show you something I have one more thing so let me just remove this stuff from here so we have a file which is my data right now if you can see on left hand side we have big as well so there's a jpg image if I open that you can see it's my photo here so this is of a simple photo what our doors I want to copy this file or maybe I want to print all the data about that file can you print data of course right when you talk about image it is made up of the binary formats wide the pixel intensity all those values of course those are numbers itself let me try to print the date of image let's see how that looks so I'll say for I in F I don't know if will it work or not let's try let me print I so let's see how exactly it looks like let's run this code oh we got an error it says char map okay so cannot decode oh that's the issue the thing is in files we have two different modes one is character mode and second is binary mode now when you work with file and that file has data like actors numbers you can use a character format but here you're walking with a file wide which is an image and when you work with image we don't have characters inside image right we have numbers we are binary format and that's why you need to read this file in a binary format now how do you mention that it's very easy simply use our B so RB means read binary and now let's run this code okay see that this is my values of the image okay so all these are exact code and that's why it is printing like there's no hexa values yeah so you can see we are putting all these values but then it does any sense all right this thing doesn't make any sense what I will do is I will save this data in a particular file maybe another image how do I copy this image and make another image it's very simple let's create a file oh it's a file one equal to open and the way we have done before but then this time I will give a different name I will say my hey not my Tita this time my pick dot jpg and then we will give a mold so any guess of course we have to say right but then right binary you have to make sure that we like we use right BAM binary instead of printing it you will say f1 dot right and you will write whatever is coming from the file one which is upon this file let's run this code there is no error go back to okay so you contain yourself you got my Pig open that oh we got a picture okay so you can see we have two copies of my image this is what amazed the second image right so this is how you can work with files with characters and Manolis let me know in the comment section if you are enjoying this series and if you have any doubts as well so that's it hit that

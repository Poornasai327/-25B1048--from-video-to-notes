In this video we will try to focus on files but why do we need files in the first place. Most of the data which we use in variables are temporary data. What if you want to store something for a longer period but then in a simple format and the best way to go for is text so let's imagine if we have a text file here. Python allows you to print a data from a file in Python. When you say read it will print everything when you say we'd line. If you don't want to print the entire file you can p. ame and you need to also mention the mode now it is mode here. In order to write the data first of all let me remove that C we cannot use our to write something we have to use W to write some things. The way you can print data is by saying f1 dot and you can use a w. After every line you have a new line and in this data as well you have new line right. nter will move to the third line. The way you can print data is by saying f1 dot and you can use a write command so you can say it right. The best way is to use Ford lobe and you say for data in F right so what it will d. e output look at the file can you see that we lost all the previous data right so we lost something we lost people we only have laptop now. The best way is to use Ford lobe and you say for data in F right so what it will do is it will run a loop and on a file F of course it will try to fetch everything one by one. When your file will get over that will be impossible to track so the best way  is you can actually use Ford lobes. When you work with image we don't have characters inside image right we have numbers we are binary format and that's why you need to read this file in a binary format. Manolis shows you how to work with files with characters and Manolis. shows how to print a picture with two copies of the same image.
